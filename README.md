Hi, Iâ€™m Damien. 

I start building lots of side projects and try my best to finish them but often get distracted with new ideas for other side projects and my "google graveyard" is forever growing ðŸ˜…

I also like contributing where and when I can to open source software or projects such as [Norfolk Developers](https://www.norfolkdevelopers.com/), [XState Catalogue](https://xstate-catalogue.com/), [React Simple Hook Modal](https://react-simple-hook-modal.vercel.app/) and [Remix](https://remix.run/)

I work at [Huler](https://huler.io/) as a Frontend Developer. For more information about me, where I've been, what I've done, check out my website (link below).
